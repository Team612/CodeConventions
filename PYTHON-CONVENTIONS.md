# Python Coding Style Guide
These rules are meant as guidelines for writing python for FIRST Team 612. These
are not hard-and-fast rules; code should first and foremost be designed in a
logical manner. However, these guidelines allow consistency and readability to
be maintained across all of the robot's code. Do not break them without good
reason.

All Python code should strictly follow the PEP8 Standard, with the exception of naming styles. This standard can be
found at [this link](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

For naming conventions, we will be using CamelCase, with uppercase names denoting class and module names, and lowercase names for variables and functions. Constants will be in all caps and are the only place where underscores are allowed as separators in names.
