# Code Conventions

This repository contains the most current versions of all of Chantilly Robotics

Current standards include:

| Language/Tool       | Filename                                                       |

| Git                 | [GIT-CONVENTIONS.md](CodeConventions/GIT-CONVENTIONS.md)       |

All added documents should conform to similar naming standards, using the 
following format:

  TOOLNAME-CONVENTIONS.md
  TOOLNAME-GUIDE.md

Notice that the entire file name excluding the extension is capitalized.

Markdown conventions should be used, including tables, headers, and `code blocks`.
