# Code Conventions

## Note: This repository is currently outdated. Please check out [this repository](https://github.com/Team612/612-ProgrammingResources), which should have the most up-to-date code conventions and documentation.

This repository contains ~~the most current~~ outdated versions of all of Chantilly Robotics
612's code and tool conventions documents.

Current standards include:

| Language/Tool | Filename              |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| C++           | C-CONVENTIONS.md      |
| Python        | PYTHON-CONVENTIONS.md |
| Git           | GIT-CONVENTIONS.md    |
| Java          | JAVA-CONVENTIONS.md   |


All added documents should conform to similar naming standards, using the 
following format:

  TOOLNAME-CONVENTIONS.md

Notice that the entire file name excluding the extension is capitalized.

Markdown conventions should be used, including tables, headers, and `code blocks`.
