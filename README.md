# Code Conventions

This repository contains the most current versions of all of Chantilly Robotics
612's code and tool conventions documents.

Current standards include:

| Language/Tool | Filename              |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| C++           | C-CONVENTIONS.md      |
| Python        | PYTHON-CONVENTIONS.md |
| Git           | GIT-CONVENTIONS.md    |


All added documents should conform to similar naming standards, using the 
following format:

  TOOLNAME-CONVENTIONS.md

Notice that the entire file name excluding the extension is capitalized.

Markdown conventions should be used, including tables, headers, and `code blocks`.
