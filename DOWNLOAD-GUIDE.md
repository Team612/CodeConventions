# Software Download Guide

This guide will show you how to download the software necessary to do FRC-related programming.

## Intro

FRC uses the Java programming language and a library called WPILib (developed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute), as well as a few other external libraries. We also use the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) text editor.

Java, WPILib, and VSCode can all be installed from the same source.

We also use Git to push code to GitHub, which is like a Google Drive for code.

## Installing Java, WPILib, and VSCode:

Follow the instructions from the [WPILib page](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html). [Here](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases) is the page where you actually download the package.

When you come to [this image](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/_images/installer-vscode-download.png), select either "Download VSCode for Single Install" or "Download VSCode for Offline Install." If you already have VSCode installed, you can't install WPILib on top of that, unfortunately. You may be able to use a ZIP file of VSCode. See the above WPILib page for more details.

On the page with the checkboxes, select all of the options available.

## Installing Git

1. Install git from [here](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Just keep selecting the "next" button for the most part. When you get to the part where it mentions editors, it is suggested to check "VSCode" instead of "Vim," as VSCode is much easier to edit in for beginners.
